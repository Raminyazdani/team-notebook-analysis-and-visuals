## Problem & Approach

**Problem it Solves:**  
Demonstrates practical application of regression analysis techniques for housing price prediction. Shows how to approach a supervised learning problem systematically, from exploratory data analysis through model comparison and evaluation.

**Approach:**
1. Exploratory data analysis of California Housing dataset
2. Feature correlation analysis and multicollinearity detection
3. Implementation of linear regression with single predictor (baseline)
4. Multiple linear regression with selected features
5. Comparison with K-Nearest Neighbors regression
6. Comprehensive evaluation using RSS, MSE, and R² metrics
7. Visual analysis through correlation matrices and residual plots

## Inputs & Outputs

**Inputs:**
- scikit-learn's built-in California Housing dataset
  - 20,640 samples
  - 8 numeric features (MedInc, HouseAge, AveRooms, AveBedrms, Population, AveOccup, Latitude, Longitude)
  - Target: Median house value (MedHouseVal)

**Outputs:**
- Statistical summaries and data exploration results
- Correlation matrices and scatter plot matrices
- Trained regression models (Linear, KNN)
- Performance metrics:
  - Residual Sum of Squares (RSS)
  - Mean Squared Error (MSE)
  - R² score
- Visualization plots:
  - Scatter matrices
  - Residual vs. fitted plots
  - Model comparison visualizations

## Project Value

This notebook serves as a comprehensive reference for:
- Implementing and comparing regression techniques
- Understanding model evaluation metrics
- Visualizing model performance
