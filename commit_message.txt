Ramin Yazdani | California Housing Regression Analysis | main | WIP(docs): Add dataset description to README (OOPS: wrong dataset)

Added dataset description section to README, but accidentally referenced 'Boston Housing dataset' instead of 'California Housing dataset' due to working with multiple sklearn datasets. This is a common copy-paste error that will be fixed in next commit.
